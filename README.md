# AdvancedReactRedux

This app is based on the one in the following repo: https://github.com/StephenGriderStephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter.git

If you are interested in the course I took - please go here: [Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

###About this repo###

This repo focuses on more complex interactions between React and Redux - specifically when passing data and state between pages in an application.

*Pages are not really pages...we are just making the user think they are navigating to various pages because of the routes. In reality, they are being show different components.*

It uses react-router and interacts with a REST service to GET, POST, DELETE based on the URL
